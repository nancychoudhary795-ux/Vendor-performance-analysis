Business Problem

Effective inventory and sales management are critical for optimizing profitability in the retail and wholesale industry. Companies need to ensure that they are not incurring losses due to inefficient pricing, poor inventory turnover, or vendor dependency. The goal of this analysis is to:

Identify underperforming brands that require promotional or pricing adjustments.
Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit.
Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs.
Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs and improve efficiency.
Investigate the profitability variance between high-performing and low-performing vendors.
