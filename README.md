Business Problem

Effective inventory and sales management are critical for optimizing profitability in the retail and wholesale industry. Companies need to ensure that they are not incurring losses due to inefficient pricing, poor inventory turnover, or vendor dependency. The goal of this analysis is to:

ÔÉò	Identify underperforming brands that require promotional or pricing adjustments.   
ÔÉò	Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit.     
ÔÉò	Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs.     
ÔÉò	Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs and improve efficiency.    
ÔÉò	Investigate the profitability variance between high-performing and low-performing vendors.

Negative & Zero Values:
Gross Profit: Minimum of -52,002.78, indicating potential losses due to high costs or heavy discounts. This could be due to selling products at lower prices than their purchase costs.

Profit Margin: Has a minimum of -‚àû, which suggests instances where revenue is zero or even lower than the total cost, leading to extreme negative profit margins.

Total Sales Quantity & Sales Dollars: Some products show zero sales, indicating they were purchased but never sold. These may be slow-moving or obsolete stock, leading to inventory inefficiencies.

Outliers Detected by High Standard Deviations:
Purchase & Actual Prices: The maximum values (5,681.81¬†&¬†7,499.99)

Freight Cost: Extreme variation from 0.09 to 257,032.07 suggests logistics inefficiencies, bulk shipments, or erratic shipping costs across different products.

Stock Turnover: Ranges from 0 to 274.5, suggesting some products sell rapidly while others remain unsold for long periods. A value greater than 1 indicates that sales for a product exceed the purchased quantity due to older stock fulfilling orders.

Dta filtering:
To enhance the reliability of the insights , we removed inconistent data points where:
‚Ä¢	Gross profit <= 0 (to exclude transactions leading to losses).
‚Ä¢	Profit margin<=0(to ensure analysis focuses on profitable transactions).
‚Ä¢	Total sales quantity=0(to eliminate inventory that was never sold)

CORRELATION INSIGHTS

Purchase price VS Total sales dollar and Gross profit:  Week correlation (-0.012 and-0.016) ,indicating that price variation do not significantly impact sales revenue or profit.
Total purchase quantity VS Total sales quantity: Strong correlation (0.999) , confirming efficient inventory turnover.
Profit margin VS Total sales price: Negative correlation (-0,179), suggesting increasing sales price may lead to reduced margins, possibly due to competitive pricing pressure.
Stock turnover VS Gross profit & Profit margin: weak negative correlation ,indicating that faster stock turnover does not necessarily equate to higher profitability.


Research questions and key findings

These brand exhibit lower sales but higher progit margins, which could benefit from targeted marketing, promotions or price optimization to increase volume without compromising profitability.
